2.Assignment 1 - Make a dataset.md(pdf)
Short description: 
The dataset I created is image-based. I mainly used the jmd_imagescraper as the main function, which is an easy-to-use web-scraping method. With jmd_imagescraper , I collect 1,000 images of cats and dogs (500 each) from the DuckDuckGo search engine. 
First things first, we need to create an environment for dataset creation. A virtual environment lets you have a stable, reproducible, and portable environment, making you are in control of which packages versions are installed and when they are upgraded, which is a huge benefit, especially when there could be tons of dependencies. The making of a virtual environment can be very flexible; for myself, I use conda to manage virtual environments. Here, I name the virtual environment to be AI 4 Media ; I will finish all the actions in this environment.
